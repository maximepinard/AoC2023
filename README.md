My attempt at Advent of Code 2023 in Go

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

As I recently learned about this challenge and wanted to start learning go, so I decided it was the perfect opportunity to write my first go lines with this challenge.
I am coming from a web background with a PHP and javascript developer experience. Go appeals to me because it has the charms of a high-level language while combining certain low-level language elements to deliver decent performance.
I'm quite happy with the choice of composition over inheritance, not having to manage memory with pointers and having garbage collection.
